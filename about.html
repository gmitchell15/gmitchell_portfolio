            My journey to where I am today began when I transfered to Pellissippi State Community College.
            I transfered to Pellissippi in the Summer of 2018. I originally went to ETSU for Computer 
            Science and decided it just was not for me. I remembered that I enjoyed photography and 
            decided to do that. After earning my degree in photography I decided to earn another 
            degree to add to my lists of skills. What I am currently working on is a degree in 
            web technology. I decided on this after seeing that jobs I was interested in wanted 
            experience with HTML and CSS. 
        </p>
		<p>
			I believe that I would be a valuable asset because of my skills in Web Design and
			Photography. I also bring two Associate degrees to the table to back up my skills.
			I also feel that I will be vaulable because while I am working I will still be learning 
			new skills from the classes that I take while working towards a Bachelor's Degree.

            I am currently working on getting my bachelor's degree in Computer Information Tecnology
            with a focus in Internet and Web Technology. I am attending Austin Peay State University in
            Clarksville, Tennessee and plan on graduating in December of 2022.
