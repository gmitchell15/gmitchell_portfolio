                Pellissippi State Community College regularly has exhibitions in the
                Bagwell show room. In addition to student work, professional work
                is also shown. You can still have work shown even after you have
                graduated. Each major, like Photography, have at least one exhibitions
                a semester. There is also the Annual Juried Exhibition where students 
                in visual art classes can submit work to be displayed. Awards are given
                out such as first place having their work purchased by the college for $500.
